## My contributions to the project:

- It was a great experience working with my team.  I have nothing but praise for all the members, their attitudes were great.  We helped each other through tough problems and managed to make a compelling product

- I worked with the sound effects.  I added the **howler** library and learned how to use it.  We faced multiple problems, with the theme song looping infinitely, to sound effects breaking the program.  I focused a lot on the useEffect hook in React.

- I also made the gameplay more dynamic.  With only a few days left in our deadline, our game was looking like a plain old battle simulator with random attacks and health damage.  I implemented a **timer** and the **"Don't attack!"** feature to put pressure on the player and make things more interesting.  Although we would have liked to make the game more expansive, I am pleased with the result.

The theme song is ["Littleroot Town - Pokémon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGCzCn5azI), sung by the titular Bernard.
